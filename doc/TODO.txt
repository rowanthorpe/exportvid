TODO:
=====

* Add more platform definitions.

* Implement expanding and looping over wildcards as input ("globbing").

* Find a locale-independent, portable wasy to set creation time from system time using batch-script (almost impossible - not worth it..?).
 => Parse and insert datetime metadata properly.

* Don't just presume a recent version of ffmpeg - try to adapt behaviour based on installed version of ffmpeg.

* Release a version with bundled ffmpeg.
